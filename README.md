### Developer-Centric Enhancements

- **New Flow Format**: Creating a Domain Specific Language (DSL) for flows to allow text-based editing alongside visual tools.
- **Code + Visual Flows**: Building hybrid workflows that combine code and visual elements with an option to toggle between them.
- **Embedded Visual Studio Coding Editor**: Adding a robust coding experience for the Function node with [Monaco Editor](https://github.com/react-monaco-editor/react-monaco-editor).
- **Git Integration**: Implementing version control, branching, and flow publishing with Git support, including offline editing of the code and syncing with the workspace.
- **Generative Flow Designer**: Introduce a chat-based assistant within the designer to assist in building automation flows.

- **Ability to Run Flow from Command Line**: ``robomotion run main.flow``

### Robust Tooling and Debugging

- **Breakpoints and Debugging**: Enhancing debugging tools with live variable watching capabilities.
- **Replay**: Allows the user to re-execute the node's actions by simulating the message input, enabling quick debugging, recovery and development.
- **Flow Analytics**: Adding detailed analytics for task execution times, bottlenecks, and success rates.

### Advanced Features

- **WASM-Based Chrome Extension**: Developing a new extension that leverages WebAssembly and WebSocket connections to seamlessly attach to existing Chrome sessions.
- **Advanced Tracing**: Building a tracing and logging system with OpenTelemetry to track execution times for each node in a flow.
- **Collaborative Editing**: Adding real-time collaborative flow editing to the Designer.
- **Better AI Model Integrations**: Providing flexible integration with cloud-based or on-premise AI models.
- **AI Agents Support**: Expanded tools for developing AI agents, including observability dashboards to monitor metrics like tokens spent and loop iterations.
- **Self-Learning AI Agents**: Working on agents that learn and adapt to tasks, acting as collaborative team members in workflows.
- **AI Agent Skill Marketplace**: Setting up a marketplace for sharing or purchasing AI agent skills.

### Community Engagement
